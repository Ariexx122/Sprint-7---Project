## How It Works

This Streamlit app provides interactive visualizations for a dataset of used vehicle listings.

- When launched, the app loads data from `vehicles_us.csv`.
- Users can choose between two visualization options:
  - **Histogram**: Displays the distribution of odometer readings across all listings.
  - **Scatter Plot**: Shows the relationship between odometer readings and other variables (e.g., price or year).

Simply select the desired option using the buttons in the sidebar, and the corresponding Plotly chart will be rendered dynamically.
